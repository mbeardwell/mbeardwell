I am a Computer Science graduate and aspiring SOC Analyst focused on threat detection, OSINT, log
analysis, and security automation. I have completed 100+ security rooms on TryHackMe and developed
technical projects through independent research. Currently, Iâ€™m actively building practical
experience in network security, scripting, and incident response to position myself for a Security
Operations role.
