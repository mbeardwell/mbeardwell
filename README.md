== Bio ==

I am a Computer Science graduate and aspiring SOC Analyst focused on threat detection, OSINT, log
analysis, and security automation. Having completed 100+ security rooms on TryHackMe and technical
projects through independent research, I am actively building practical skills in network security,
scripting, and incident response to prepare for a Security Operations role.
