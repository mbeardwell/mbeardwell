# Matthew Beardwell | Aspiring SOC Analyst   

## About Me  
I am an aspiring SOC Analyst with a First-Class Honours BSc in Computer Science from King’s College London. My interests include security operations, threat detection, log analysis, and network security.  

I have hands-on experience with SIEM platforms, network traffic analysis, and security tools, and I am actively developing my skills through projects and research in cybersecurity.  

## Technical Skills  
### Security and SOC Tools  
- SIEM: Splunk (basic)  
- Network Security: Wireshark, Firewall Configurations, TCP/IP  
- Threat Analysis: OSINT, Burp Suite, Metasploit  
- Log Analysis: Sysmon, Windows Event Logs  

### Programming and Automation  
- Python (log parsing, network scanning, automation)  
- Bash
- C & ARM Assembly (low-level security)  

## Featured Projects  

### TCP Port Scanner  
- **Technology:** Python, Multithreading  
- **Description:** Scans for open TCP ports and detects live hosts  
- **Repository:** [View Project](https://github.com/mbeardwell/simple-port-scanner)  

### Neural Network Language Classifier  
- **Technology:** Python
- **Description:** Classifies words into languages using a neural network  
- **Repository:** [View Project](https://github.com/mbeardwell/language-guesser)  

### Faster Dynamically Instrumented Programs  
- **Technology:** C, Assembly, Dynamic Binary Instrumentation  
- **Description:** Third-year university project at King’s College London exploring floating-point emulation in ARM Linux.  
  This project proposes a more efficient method for emulating floating-point instructions by replacing them with direct branches to emulation code within the same process' memory. The goal was to reduce execution overhead caused by kernel-based emulation.
